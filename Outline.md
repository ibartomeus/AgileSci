**Title:** What ecologists can learn from software developers?


**Intro:**

- Recent changes in ecology. Increase number of colaborators (see Neff & Olden 2010 Bioscience, Wuchty, S., B. F. Jones, and B. Uzzi. 2007. The increasing dominance of teams in production of knowledge. Science 316:1036-1039.), increase use of R, quantity/quality tradeoff, open science.

- What Problems faced software devolpements and how they solved them (or try to solve them). Increase the quantity without decreasing quality (if quality is the way to go is not discussed here, see TREE references)

- Why this problems are similar. Need to increase quantity, without decreasing quality. 

- This is not a paper about improving code (covered here), 

**Tools:**

- Version control. Good when using it alone, better whith collaborators. Reproducible Scicene (Not covered here)

- Pair programing. Among equals, not replace mentoring, add to it. Increase moltivation and crativity. For example in initial stages on data analysis, or in the writing process. Avoid white page syndrome. Despite collaboration in research has increased, writting and analysis is still a solitary process. Reduce errors. In science, specially difficult to find. Any ref 
showing error decrease?

- Explicitly encourage to spend 20% of your time in something not related to your research agenda, PHD… for example, read about other topic, do a blog or divulgate science, or learn programming. Any reference proving that this increase creativity?

- Increase interactions. Good job among lab memners, sometimes at department level, but what about sharing space with the fisics department? Economists? Examples of common restrooms, etc...

- Agile development, be incremental (already done?) and improve communication by lab meetings, revision and lanning of the goals, How get the best of lab meetings!
 
- GDT?

- Replicability ideas, open science ideas...


**Where to submit:**

- Submit to TREE, F1000Research, oikos… or http://www.immediatescience.org/

**Plan:**

- Brainstorm first? Work on the same document? Do a Pair writting?
