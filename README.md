-Can science be more agile?

This is a short paper to try to apply some software Agile development techniques to ecology research.

-What can field ecologists can learn from software programmers?

I'm an ecologist, but I have some friends that are software developers. I realized that the basic problems we face while working are quite similar, and that they are ahead of us in solving those problems. This started as a blog post, but we want to reach a broader audience. Ideally we want to reach ecologists that are not computer oriented, that are nor R addicts, that don't read boinformatic journals (even less geeky blogs) and that never ever heard about version control. Can we turn that into a TREE paper? Or a Oikos Forum paper? Can we show other way of working to old school field ecologists? Can we get the attention of new PhD students that are not expose to other ways of thinking during their regular PhD courses?

If you want to collaborate, send me an email and I'll add you to the repo. I am still learning all this stuff, which I think is good to bridge the gap, but I would wellcome more experienced collaborators (and yes, coauthorship is open). 

Thanks in advance,
Ignasi
